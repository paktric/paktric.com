# Project Overview
### Motivation
This project is a web portfolio where I can showcase my programming projects.

### Objective
- Practice my web development and design skills
- Document my various programming projects
- Learn about domain and hosting management

<br />

# Development Process
### Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS
- Figma for design prototype
- cPanel for website management
- GitHub for version control

### Implementation
The first part of the project was getting a domain and hosting plan. I bought my domain and went with a hosting option that allowed me to manage my Linux host using cPanel. My website is just a showcase for my work, so I didn't think I needed an SSL certificate because I'm not dealing with sensitive data transfer. What I didn't realize was that not having an SSL cert negatively effects your SEO ranking. I found that Cloudflare offers a free SSL cert, so I registered for that. 

The next step was to start building my website. I wanted to get something online to verify my hosting was working, so I created a simple placeholder that links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and Resume. A friend of mine who is an excellent UI/UX designer gave me a crash course on Figma and is helping me to create a more professional website design. Stay tuned for the finished product!

### Challenges
- Figma and cPanel were completely new to me, so there was a bit of a learning curve there.
- Using CSS to style my website was full of challenges. There are a lot of keywords to memorize so I found myself looking at a lot of documentation and code snippets to help me get through it.

# Conclusion
This project is teaching me a lot about the web design process and is helping me strengthen my HTML and CSS skills. Learning cPanel was a bit overkill for a web portfolio and if I had to do it again, I'd probably just use GitHub Pages and do DNS forwarding to my domain.
