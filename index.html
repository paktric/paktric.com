            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                Hey 👋😎 I’m Patrick Moran – a recent Computer Science graduate of West Chester University.
            </p>
            <p>
                Discovering my passion for Computer Science was not a clear-cut journey. When I started college, I studied general engineering classes with a focus on Mechanical Engineering. I’ve always been interested in how things work and enjoyed hands-on projects, so I figured that was my calling. At the end of my sophomore year, I wanted some practical experience, so I got an internship with a medical device manufacturing company. I loved the work I was doing – it was challenging, hands-on, and meaningful. I put my education on hold and continued working in the industry for almost 5 years, learning invaluable skills such as project management, technical writing, problem solving, and effective communication. Although an enjoyable career path, I sought to complete a bachelor's degree.
            </p>
            <p>    
                It began with a curiosity around computer programming, so I took a course and found myself immediately hooked! I grew an interest around software development, cybersecurity, human-computer interaction and assistive technologies. My goal is to find challenging and meaningful work that aligns with my interests.
